  abstract = {This article aims to describe the implementation of an autonomous control system for the Brazilian Navy's Unmanned Surface Vehicle Laboratory (USV-Lab) using the MOOS-IvP framework. The main goal of this project is to enable an existing vehicle to be a laboratory for research of maritime autonomous systems, to perform unmanned maritime missions, following desired routes without human intervention or being remotely piloted. Results revealed the system’s effectiveness and robustness in maintaining configured routes, enabling its use in a Brazilian Navy military reconnaissance exercise, as well as serving as a laboratory for future research.},
